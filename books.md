### Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control

**Author**: Walter A. Shewhart

Shewhart's distinction between assignable variation and common cause variation is crucial in software testing. Assignable variation in software might be bugs or errors introduced by a specific change in the code, while common cause variation could be inherent complexity or challenges in the software development environment.

If a QA engineer misinterprets the normal variability in test results (such as minor fluctuations in performance metrics) as a sign of a significant problem, they might unnecessarily adjust or overhaul stable processes. This over-correction can disrupt a well-functioning system, leading to wasted resources and potentially introducing new issues.

If a QA engineer mistakes common variation in the system's behavior for an assignable bug, they might spend excessive time and resources trying to fix something that is actually a normal behavior of the system, leading to inefficient use of time and possibly causing frustration in the team.

If a common variation is misinterpreted as an assignable cause, a QA engineer might implement specific fixes or patches that don't address the underlying systemic issue. This could lead to recurring problems, as the true cause is never addressed.

Misinterpreting data can also lead to poor decision-making about where to allocate resources. For instance, an engineer might focus on optimizing a part of the software that is actually performing within acceptable limits, while neglecting areas that require more attention.

Frequent and unnecessary changes in response to perceived problems (that are actually common variations) can destabilize the testing process. This instability can lead to a lack of confidence in the testing process itself, both from the QA team and from other stakeholders.

Constantly responding to what are perceived as issues (but are actually normal variations) can be demoralizing for the team. It might create a sense of chasing endless problems, leading to burnout or reduced job satisfaction.
### The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education

**Author**:  W. Edwards Deming

Deming is often referred to as "The Father of Quality" due to his revolutionary contributions to the field of quality assurance and management. His influence is pervasive in both the theoretical and practical aspects of quality in manufacturing, service industries, and beyond. Deming coined the Total Quality Management (TQM) — a structured approach to overall organizational management, the focus of the process is to improve the quality of an organization's outputs, including goods and services, through the continual improvement of internal practices.

He proceeded the works of Shewhart regarding variation, but added much more to the quality management side.

If QA folks don't read and understand Deming's work, particularly the part about the importance of long-term strategic planning and continuous improvement, they might prioritize immediate fixes or short-term goals at the expense of more sustainable, long-term quality improvements. This approach can lead to recurring problems and lower overall product quality.

Deming advocated for improving processes rather than relying heavily on inspection. QA engineers unfamiliar with this might [focus too much on finding and fixing defects after they occur, rather than preventing them through better processes](https://qase.io/blog/qa-qc-and-quality/). This reactive approach is less efficient and effective than building quality into the process from the start.

Deming's System of Profound Knowledge promotes understanding the organization as a system. Without this perspective, managers may fail to see how different parts of the system affect each other, [potentially leading to ineffective solutions that don't address systemic issues](https://qase.io/blog/performance-reviews-and-quality/).

Deming warned against management by objectives without understanding the processes. QA engineers might focus on meeting numerical targets (like a certain number of tests or bug fixes) without considering whether these activities actually improve quality.

Deming’s teachings include the importance of a culture that continually strives for better quality. Without this mindset, QA practices might become stagnant, failing to evolve with changing technologies and methods.

Deming encouraged breaking down barriers between departments. QA engineers not following this might work in isolation from other departments, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of shared knowledge and goals.

### MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES for the 21st Century

**Author**: Peter F. Drucker

In the realm of QA, the emphasis on knowledge work underscores the importance of skilled QA professionals who are not just testers, but also [critical thinkers and problem solvers](https://qase.io/blog/generalist-vs-specialist/). Understanding and managing these knowledge workers effectively is crucial for the success of QA teams.

Drucker suggested to move towards more networked and less hierarchical organizational structures which means cross-functional collaboration of QA with development, operations and other teams. QA teams working in isolation may develop blind spots regarding how users actually interact with the product. Cross-functional collaboration helps provide broader insights, leading to more user-centric testing.

Drucker's focus on the impact of technology aligns well with the constantly evolving landscape of software development and testing. QA teams must be adaptive, continuously learning new tools and approaches (like automation, AI in testing) to stay effective.

### Goldratt's Theory of Constraints: a Systems Approach to Continuous Improvement

**Author**: Eliyahu M. Goldratt

**Link**: https://www.amazon.com/Goldratts-Theory-Constraints-Continuous-Improvement/dp/B001DORDE8/

Goldratt's seminal work introduces and elaborates on the Theory of Constraints (TOC), a management paradigm that seeks to identify and manage the most limiting factor (i.e., constraint) in a process or system. TOC states that the whole system's capacity is limited by its constraints.

This means that if the organisational is structured in such a such a way that the QA specialists are in a separate department, the whole department might be a constraint, leading to bigger queues, worse quality and the overall system slowness.

As an approach, TOC helps finding the best opportunities for improvement in any process, and QA teams can expend efforts on optimizing parts of the process that are actual bottlenecks, leading to maximum overall improvements. The greatest gains often come from addressing the system's primary constraint.

Without identifying and focusing on constraints, resources (time, personnel, tools) might be misallocated. This could result in spending too much on areas that don't significantly improve quality or efficiency.

If constraints within the QA process are not identified and managed, it could lead to decreased product quality. For instance, if the constraint is inadequate test coverage due to limited resources, critical bugs might be missed, affecting the end product.

TOC also highlights the need for cross-functional collaboration to address constraints. Lack of such collaboration in QA can lead to misunderstandings and inefficiencies, especially in environments where QA needs to work closely with development, operations, and other departments.
