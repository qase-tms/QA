Shewhart's distinction between assignable variation and common cause variation is crucial in software testing. Assignable variation in software might be bugs or errors introduced by a specific change in the code, while common cause variation could be inherent complexity or challenges in the software development environment.

If a QA engineer misinterprets the normal variability in test results (such as minor fluctuations in performance metrics) as a sign of a significant problem, they might unnecessarily adjust or overhaul stable processes. This over-correction can disrupt a well-functioning system, leading to wasted resources and potentially introducing new issues.

If a QA engineer mistakes common variation in the system's behavior for an assignable bug, they might spend excessive time and resources trying to fix something that is actually a normal behavior of the system, leading to inefficient use of time and possibly causing frustration in the team.

If a common variation is misinterpreted as an assignable cause, a QA engineer might implement specific fixes or patches that don't address the underlying systemic issue. This could lead to recurring problems, as the true cause is never addressed.

Misinterpreting data can also lead to poor decision-making about where to allocate resources. For instance, an engineer might focus on optimizing a part of the software that is actually performing within acceptable limits, while neglecting areas that require more attention.

Frequent and unnecessary changes in response to perceived problems (that are actually common variations) can destabilize the testing process. This instability can lead to a lack of confidence in the testing process itself, both from the QA team and from other stakeholders.

Constantly responding to what are perceived as issues (but are actually normal variations) can be demoralizing for the team. It might create a sense of chasing endless problems, leading to burnout or reduced job satisfaction.
